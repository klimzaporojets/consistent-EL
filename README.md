# Towards Consistent Document-level Entity Linking:Joint Models for Entity Linking and Coreference Resolution
This repository is a __WORK IN PROGRESS__ and will contain the code, 
dataset, and models for the following paper accepted to ACL 2022 (oral presentation): 
```
@article{zaporojets2021towards,
  title={Towards Consistent Document-level Entity Linking: Joint Models for Entity Linking and Coreference Resolution},
  author={Zaporojets, Klim and Deleu, Johannes and Jiang, Yiwei and Demeester, Thomas and Develder, Chris},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.13530},
  year={2021}
}
```

The module where most of the _local_ model logic is implemented is: ```src/modules/tasks/coreflinker_hoi.py```.

The module where most of the _global_ model logic is implemented is: ```src/modules/tasks/coreflinker_mtt_hoi.py``` 

We expect to finish refactoring and cleaning the repository by mid June 2022.
