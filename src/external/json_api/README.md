This package contains the classes needed to load a model and respond
to http requests (GET/POST?). The initial idea is to take as input
plain text and return predicted mentions, mention types, links, 
coreference clusters, relations, etc. A similar implementation is done in 
related work: https://github.com/dalab/end2end_neural_el/tree/master/code/gerbil .
